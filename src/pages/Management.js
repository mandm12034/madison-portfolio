        Business is the way the world works. So, to me, it is a
        very fun topic to learn about. While in high school,
        I decided I would become a business major, and started
        taking a lot of business classes for dual enrollment. 
        These were just small introductory classes but they had
        so much useful information that I still use to this day.
        </p>

        While in college, I started looking at more advanced 
        management classes - Legal and Ethical Environment of 
        Business, Financial Management of the Firm, Business 
        Communications, Organizational Behavior, and Strategic 
        Management and Business Policy.
        </p>
        <p>
        All of these classes taught me how to successfully 
        run a business and how to become a better leader. 
        I cannot wait to take what I have learned from 
        these classes and put it into my daily life and 
        in my future career.
