        <p>
        I have worked in service for almost 5 years now. 
        I have worked my first job at Dairy Queen to my most 
        previous job at Subway right on FSU’s campus. My service 
        jobs have taught me a lot of skills that I would like to 
        take into my career. I have learned a lot about leadership 
        from my managers, I have also learned to adapt quickly to 
        new situations, and I know how to work well under pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
        My experience in service has also inspired me to look into
        getting a minor in Hospitality Management. FSU’s college 
        of Hospitality has the most fun and rewarding classes
        I will ever take at school. I have taken International
        Protocol, where I learned about how every country operates
        and how to interact with them based on their cultures.
        I also took interesting classes such as Distilled Spirits
        and International Culture, and Introduction to 
        Hospitality and Tourism Management, which were really
        cool classes just to learn more about the hospitality
        industry overall.
        </p>
        <p>
        I do love to interact with new people and different
        cultures, but I would also like to expand my knowledge
        and love of technology into the hospitality world too.
