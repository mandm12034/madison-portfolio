        <p>
        C++ is my newest adventure in college. 
        I knew absolutely nothing about programming 
        or code until I enrolled in Programming 1. 
        Programming 1 teaches the very basics of C++, 
        but I am excited to gain more knowledge about it 
        as we go further into the semester.
        </p>
        <p>
        While I havenâ€™t even scratched the surface of 
        C++, I am venturing into new territory with Java, 
        and I have built this whole website with Java 
        (and with the help of my brother). My brother has 
        taught me only the few commands that it takes to 
        update and create new pages, but I feel very accomplished 
        to have built a whole website basically by myself.
