        <p>
        My last semester in college, it took up learning programming. That led me to C++.
        I knew absolutely nothing about programming or code until I enrolled in Programming 1. 
        Programming 1 teaches the very basics of C++, But I felt I learned more than just the basics.
        I was taught everything from "cout" to "cin", functions, arrays, and other topics.
        </p>
        <p>
        While I still havenâ€™t even scratched the surface of 
        C++, I am venturing into new territory with JavaScript, 
        and I have built this whole website with JavaScript 
        (and with the help of my brother). My brother has 
        taught me only the few commands that it takes to 
        update and create new pages, but I feel very accomplished 
        to have built a whole website basically by myself.
